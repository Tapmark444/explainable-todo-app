# Explainable To-Do App

This project assigns task priority using transparent, rule-based logic.

## How it works
Priority = (Difficulty × 2) + Time Estimate

The app explains *why* a task is High, Medium, or Low priority.

## Why unique
Unlike normal to-do apps, this system provides reasoning behind decisions,
inspired by Explainable AI (XAI) concepts.
